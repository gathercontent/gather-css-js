Managing CSS & JS the [GatherContent](https://gathercontent.com) way
===========================================

AutoVersion script inspired by Chris Coyier's [FOWA slides](http://css-tricks.com/writing-better-html-css-slides-from-fowa-london/).

Read a blog post about it: [GatherContent Blog](http://blog.gathercontent.com)

In a nutshell, this script lets you combine and compress CSS and JS files, so that you can organise them in folders as you see fit (even into hundreds of separate files), saving browser calls to the server in the same time.

Cache gets automatically invalidated when you make a change to any of the files listed in any _dynamic.php file by changing ?v=[timestamp] part, which forces browser to download file again.
